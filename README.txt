This is the accepted solution of project 2 of the "Programming for Data Science with Python" NanoDegree.

It analyzes bikeshare data from three cities: New York City, Washington and Chicago.
(The original csv files contain 300.000 rows each, the test versions here just about a dozen rows.)

The Pandas library is used to analyze the data.

The following sources have been used to solve the Bikeshare project:
